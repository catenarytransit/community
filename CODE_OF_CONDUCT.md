# Catenary Community Guidelines

## Our Principles
We pledge to make participation in Catenary’s community a welcoming, inclusive, and enjoyable experience for everyone. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community, and hold everyone in our community to the same high standard. Catenary development is built on three key principles that we expect all community members to keep in mind:

* **Strong ideas, loosely held.** We’re not afraid to call out things that look wrong, and we always stay open to constructive criticism and feedback. We work to solve the most challenging technical problems in transit, and understand that we can only do it together. 
* **Love for transit and its riders.** We love our public transit, and we want to see more of it. We understand that transit is for everyone, and we always design our products for transit riders from all backgrounds.
* **Be excellent to each other.** Catenary is built around this shared love of public transit, and we need the help of every contributor to keep our community welcoming, diverse, and healthy.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Sharing and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
* Insulting or derogatory comments and personal attacks
* Disparaging transit systems and the people that use them
* Harassment and doxxing
* Impersonation of a Catenary official

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Catenary’s communications team leads code of conduct enforcement, and is responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. You can identify them because their names are lime green in our Discord server. Communications officers will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful, and have the right and responsibility to remove or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to these guidelines.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to Catenary’s communications team by direct messaging the Catenary account on any social media platform, or by emailing Public Information Officer Samuel Sharp at samuel@catenarymaps.org, so your complaint can reach a communications officer. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, and we will aim to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
